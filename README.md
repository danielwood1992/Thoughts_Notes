# Thoughts_Notes
Every script seems to go through the following stages:
1. It doesn't run.
2. It runs, prodcues no output.
3. It runs, produces an obviously wrong output.
4. It runs, prodcues a not obviously wrong output (it's still wrong).
5. It runs, produces the right output (but maybe not for every possible set of inputs).
6. It runs, produces the right output for all reasonable inputs (you've probably spent too long on it by this point).
