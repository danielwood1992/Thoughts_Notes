# Thoughts_Notes
Every script seems to go through the following stages:
1. It doesn't run.
2. It runs, prodcues no output.
3. It runs, produces an obviously wrong output.
4. It runs, prodcues a not obviously wrong output (it's still wrong).
5. It runs, produces the right output (but maybe not for every possible set of inputs).
